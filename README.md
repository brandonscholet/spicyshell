# spicyshell
## Description
A php shell to test the 4 php methods and run a command if one works

## Usage
Script accepts two arguments: ```cmd``` and ```breaks```

if ```cmd``` is not provided, then it will run the below commands:
```"whoami; id; uname -a"```

```breaks``` wil use PHP's NL2BR to turn line breaks into <br> tags, so new lines are kept in the browser.
